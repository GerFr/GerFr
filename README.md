## Who Am I?

I'm Gerrit, a passionate computer science student from Germany. Im interested in Machine learning and physics simulations.

## Tech Stack Snapshot

- **Proficient In:**
  - Python: My go-to language for its simplicity and versatility.
  - Git: Git is the backbone of my version control.

- **Learning:**
  - C/C++: Venturing into systems programming and low-level magic.
  - Machine Learning (Python): From regression to deep learning â€“ the data-driven adventure.

## Current Focus

N-Body Simulations (Barnes-Hut Algorithm):
Building a Python program for N-body simulations using the Barnes-Hut algorithm.
Exploring optimizations for efficient gravitational simulations in large datasets.

## Collaboration Interests

I'm always open to collaborating on exciting projects, whether it's coding, exploring new technologies, or participating in hackathons. If you're working on something cool or need an extra pair of hands, let's connect!
